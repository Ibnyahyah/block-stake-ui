## About

Block Stake UI serves as a frontend dApp for <a href="https://github.com/kingahmedino/block-stake.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Block Stake</a> which is a staking contract following a modified version of Sushiswap's MasterChef algorithm.

The dApp helps users to manage their stake and reward assets and every other information about the current staking process. The dApp uses <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metamask</a> as wallet provider while using <a href="https://walletconnect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wallet Connect</a> and <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web3dart</a> to interface between the blockchain and Metamask.
